## Description
This project taught me how javascript and the html work together to creating a page that functins. My hardest issue was making the start button work and keeping track of all the ID's and containers to make sure the project runs smoothly. I wa able to make the button function but at some point the questions wouldn't work. The broken code seemed quite difficult but helped me learn how it all works together

## Installation

To make the project work I learned new variables to make functions in JavaScript work and tie with html and css.
